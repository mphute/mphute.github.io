caption: "We synthesize a suite of generalizable architectural design principles to robustify CNNs, spanning a networkâ€™s macro and micro designs: (A) optimal range for depth and width configurations, (B) preferring convolutional over patchify stem stage, and (C) robust residual block design by adopting squeeze and excitation blocks, and non-parametric smooth activation functions. The principles consis- tently and markedly improve AutoAttack accuracy for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet over the wide spectrum of AT methods, model parameters, and network design spaces."

We aim to unify existing works' diverging opinions on how architectural components affect the adversarial robustness of CNNs. To accomplish our goal, we synthesize a suite of three generalizable robust architectural design principles: (a) optimal range for depth and width configurations, (b) preferring convolutional over patchify stem stage, and (c) robust residual block design through adopting squeeze and excitation blocks and non-parametric smooth activation functions. Through extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of dataset scales, adversarial training methods, model parameters, and network design spaces, our principles consistently and markedly improve AutoAttack accuracy: 1-3 percentage points (pp) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and 4-9 pp on ImageNet.
